# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

in this repo i created a react app with .json server file(it work like a fake db for us in this project). in this app i make some some greate stuff like sorting,filtering,search bar and pagination also.   

if you want to start using this app u need to split ur terminal because u have to start .json server in one terminal and start your react app in another terminal.
1 [terminal] -> npm run server   // it for start running your json server.
2 [terminal]  -. npm start      // it's for start running your react app
